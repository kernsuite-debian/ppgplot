Description: Pythonic Interface to PGPLOT
 ppgplot is a python module (extension) providing bindings to the 
 PGPLOT graphics library. PGPLOT is a scientific visualization 
 (graphics) library written in Fortran by T. J. Pearson. C bindings
 for PGPLOT are also available. ppgplot makes the library usable by 
 Python programs. It uses the numeric / numarray modules (nowadays 
 replaced by Numpy), to efficiently represent and manipulate vectors
 and matrices.
